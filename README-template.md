## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this challenge, I have managed to perform most of the challenge without seeking for any assistance. It was a good opportunity to feel more confident of my capabilities while useful to reassure my knowledge on responsive web design.

### Continued development

I identified the need to further practice responsiveness in CSS and to solidify flexbox understanding. Will focus on that in future projects.

### Useful resources

- [A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - Very useful resource for flexbox.
- [Responsive Web Design Basics](https://web.dev/responsive-web-design-basics/) - This article goes through many concepts needed to understand the set up of a responsive web design.
